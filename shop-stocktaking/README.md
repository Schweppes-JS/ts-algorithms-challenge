- Print to the console the total quantity of all watermelons (`Watermelons - ${quantity}`);
- Print to the console the total weight of all apples (`Apples - ${weight}`);
- Sort the array in alphabetical order by item field and print it to the console;
- Sort the array by cost of the record and print it to the console;
- Print to the terminal the type of oranges with the least price (`The cheapest orange type is: ${type}`);
- Print to the console the cost of the goods by item name (`Apples - ${costApples}, Pineapples - ${costPineapples}, Watermelons - ${costWatermelons}, Oranges - ${costOranges}`);
